 persia.1.t: "Amir Kabir's Military Reforms"
 persia.1.d: "Amir Kabir, the powerful and visionary Grand Vizier of Persia, has introduced sweeping reforms to modernize the Qajar army. For centuries, our military has relied on outdated strategies, equipment, and organization, leaving us vulnerable to the encroaching imperial powers of Europe. Amir Kabir believes that in order to preserve Persian sovereignty and protect the Shah's reign, we must adopt Western military techniques, streamline recruitment, and modernize our weaponry\n\nThe reforms include the establishment of military academies, the creation of a standing army trained in the latest European tactics, and the procurement of modern rifles and artillery. However, this move has not gone unnoticed. The conservative factions at court, fearful of change, believe these reforms will undermine traditional power structures and lead to the loss of Persian identity. The same goes for the different Tribes in our country, who fear losing their autonomy in military affairs. On the other hand, many military officers and modernist intellectuals view Amir Kabir's reforms as a necessary step to ensure the survival of the empire in a rapidly changing world."
 persia.1.a: "Support Amir Kabir's Reforms!"
 persia.1.a_tt: "The future of Persia belongs to those who embrace change."
 persia.1.b: "Slow down, Persia isn't ready for this."
 persia.1.b_tt: "Amir Kabir’s ideas are too radical; The pride of Persia lies in its traditions, not foreign imitations."
 persia.1.c: "Choose neither side, at least for now"
 persia.1.c_tt: "Reforms have their place, but tradition cannot be cast aside so easily. Persia must find its own path, balancing both the old and the new."
 
 persia.2.t: "Plans for Army Centralization"
 persia.2.d: "With the Amir Kabir reforms just beginning to take root, the government has initiated plans to fully centralize the Qajar army. Historically reliant on the contributions of tribal forces, our military has suffered from disunity, with tribal leaders maintaining significant autonomy over their soldiers, equipment, and structure. This has resulted in inefficiency and a lack of standardization, leaving Persia vulnerable to both internal and external threats.\n\n The centralization process will aim to reduce the influence of tribal leaders over military affairs, bringing the entire army under the direct control of the state. To achieve this, uniforms, rifles, artillery, and division structures will need to be standardized across the board, ensuring that every soldier, regardless of origin, is equipped and trained in the same manner.\n\n Additionally, the possibility of introducing conscription is being discussed. While this would bolster the ranks of a national standing army, it remains a contentious issue. Tribal leaders, who have historically controlled recruitment in their regions, are likely to oppose such a move, viewing it as an attack on their authority and the independence of their tribes.\n\n Though these reforms still have to be put into practice, their successful implementation will mark a new era of military unity in Persia—but the government must carefully manage the delicate balance of power with the tribal factions to avoid unrest."
 persia.2.a: "Time for change has come"
 persia.2.a_tt: "The time has come to unite Persia’s military under one banner. Though the path ahead is difficult, the state's control over the army must be strengthened to face the challenges of the modern world."

 persia.3.t: "The Tribal Armies Will Remain"
 persia.3.d: "After careful consideration following the initial Amir Kabir reforms, the government has chosen to maintain Persia’s long-standing reliance on the tribal armies. While efforts to modernize the military have been put forward, we have decided to focus on tradition and preserve the autonomy of the tribal forces. The diverse tribes of Persia have been the backbone of our military strength for centuries, and their loyalty remains crucial to the stability of the Shah’s reign.\n\n Rather than reduce the influence of the tribal leaders, the government will now shift its efforts toward strengthening and supporting their armies. This will involve improving the equipment and training available to tribal forces while respecting their unique traditions and command structures. Instead of imposing standardized uniforms or conscription, we will seek to cultivate stronger ties with the tribal chieftains and secure their loyalty through mutual cooperation and respect.\n\n By reinforcing the tribal armies, the government aims to create a decentralized yet resilient military force that can respond flexibly to threats while maintaining the delicate balance of power within the empire. This approach preserves Persia’s identity and ensures that the tribes remain a key part of our military strategy, even as the world around us modernizes."
 persia.3.a: "Ok"
 persia.3.a_tt: "The strength of Persia lies in its tribes. Rather than force change upon them, we will embrace their traditions and secure their loyalty through support, not suppression."

 persia.4.t: "The Akhunds: A Growing Presence in Persia"
 persia.4.d: "The Akhunds, a powerful faction within the Shia clergy, have long influenced the lives of the Persian people. They position themselves as the protectors of Islamic values, seeking to control religious teachings and exert influence over political decisions. Over the years, their presence has only grown, often challenging the authority of the Shah and the state. They claim to guide the people spiritually, but their ambitions extend far beyond the mosque. As Persia moves forward, the role of the Akhunds becomes an obstacle the monarchy must contend with."
 persia.4.a: "The Akhunds claim to lead with faith, but their grip tightens around Persia’s future."

 persia.5.t: "An Audience with the Ayatollahs"
 persia.5.d: "The Shah has summoned the most prominent Ayatollahs to Tehran for an audience, aiming to discuss the future of Persia. The clergy, firm in their belief that Shia Islam should guide the empire, have laid out their vision for Iran — a society deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and resistant to the influences of Western modernisation. As the Ayatollahs presented their goals, many hopeful reformists in the Shah's court expressed their concerns, fearing that the clergy's ambitions may stand in the way of the much-needed reforms that could propel Persia into a new era."
 persia.5.a: "The Ayatollahs and Shah stand together"
 persia.5.b: "Iran first Islam second"

 persia.6.t: "The Mullahs Protest the Shah’s Lack of Commitment"
 persia.6.d: "The construction of masjids has long been a critical demand of the Shia clergy, as they see these religious structures as a cornerstone of Persian society. However, after 180 days without the Shah committing the necessary funds, the mullahs have begun to protest openly. They accuse the Shah of neglecting his religious duties and turning his back on Islam. These protests have spread to the streets, with the clergy stirring up discontent among the faithful, demanding that their spiritual needs be met."
 persia.6.a: "To neglect the masjids is to neglect the will of Allah, the mullahs declare, as unrest begins to grow."

 persia.7.t: "The Shah’s Grand Reform Speech"
 persia.7.d: "The Shah has called for a grand gathering of his advisors, ministers, and representatives of the clergy to announce his vision for the future of Persia. In a bold and ambitious speech, he outlines sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing the military, government, and educational systems. The speech is met with a mix of applause and scepticism. The clergy, in particular, seem uneasy, fearing that these changes will undermine their influence. The Shah now faces the challenge of implementing these reforms while managing the growing dissent among the religious elites."
 persia.7.a: "Move forward with full reforms, regardless of clerical opposition."
 persia.7.b: "Incorporate some of the clergy’s demands into the reforms."

 persia.8.t: "Mullahs Denounce Western Schools"
 persia.8.d: "As the Shah continues to build and promote Western-style schools in Persia, opposition from the clergy has grown louder. A coalition of mullahs has publicly denounced these institutions as a threat to Islamic teachings, calling them breeding grounds for heresy and Western corruption. The public, torn between modernization and religious values, looks to the Shah for guidance. Will he side with the clergy and limit the spread of these schools, or will he stand firm in his commitment to modernization?"
 persia.8.a: "Limit the influence of Western schools to appease the clergy."
 persia.8.b: "Continue building the schools, but promise to include more religious studies."

 persia.9.t: "A Clerical Uprising in the Provinces"
 persia.9.d: "In one of the more rural provinces of Persia, a powerful local cleric has begun to rally the population around the idea that the Shah’s reforms are a threat to Islam itself. He has denounced the Shah’s efforts to modernize the empire as an attack on religious values. The local population is growing restless, with protests breaking out in several towns. The mullahs are watching the situation closely, waiting to see how the Shah responds. The Shah must decide whether to meet with the cleric, crush the unrest, or ignore the situation entirely."
 persia.9.a: "Meet with the cleric to ease tensions."
 persia.9.b: "Crush the uprising"

 persia.10.t: "The Ayatollah’s Call for Religious Unity"
 persia.10.d: "A prominent Ayatollah has issued a public call for the unification of Persia under the banner of Shia Islam. The Ayatollah claims that in these uncertain times, the nation must look to its spiritual roots and reject foreign influences. The clergy is rallying behind this call, with sermons across the country urging the faithful to follow the guidance of the mullahs and resist the encroaching modern influences of the West. The Shah faces a choice—allow the clergy to grow stronger or intervene to ensure the monarchy’s dominance."
 persia.10.a: "Support the call for religious unity and strengthen the clergy."
 persia.10.b: "Remain neutral and let the clergy’s influence rise naturally."

They live a semi-nomadic life, controlling key mountain passes in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari region, and remain influential due to their military strength."
PER_QASHQAI_TOOLTIP: "A confederation of Turkic nomads, the £faction_per_qashqai §YQashqai§! inhabit Fars Province in southwestern Persia. They resist central control, moving seasonally between pastures, and maintain strong tribal traditions rooted in their Central Asian origins."

PER_TURKMEN_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_turkmen §YTurkmen§! are nomadic Turkic people living in northeastern Persia, near the Khorasan region. Known for their cavalry and raiding, they often resist the £faction_per_qajar §YQajar§! authority and maintain their Central Asian heritage."

PER_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP: "§YLoyalty§! represents the tribe's desire to cooperate with the £faction_per_qajar §YQajars§!. \nThe higher the §YLoyalty§!, the less likely it is that a tribe will confront and cause troubles. \nBefore integrating a tribe, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to align their population and increase their §YLoyalty§! to 100."
PER_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP: "§YPopularity§! represents the support a tribe receives from the overall population. \nThe higher the §YPopularity§!, the more likely it is that a tribe will confront the £faction_per_qajar §YQajars§!. \nBefore destroying a tribe, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to weaken it and reduce its §YPopularity§! to 0."
